One of the equation editors we use, Equation Magic (MicroPress Inc., Forest
  Hills, NY; http://www.micropress-inc.com/), interprets native \TeX\ source
  code and generates an equation as an OLE picture object that can then be cut
  and pasted directly into Word. This editor, however, does not handle \LaTeX\
  environments (such as \texttt{\{array\}} or \texttt{\{eqnarray\}}); it can
  interpret only \TeX\ codes. Thus, when there's a choice, we ask that you
  avoid these \LaTeX\ calls in displayed math --- for example, that you use the
  \TeX\ \verb+\matrix+ command for ordinary matrices, rather than the \LaTeX\
  \texttt{\{array\}} environment.
